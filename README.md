# Game Day Planner

Find all the information you need to plan a successful trip to a sporting event. Search for sports related events, parking, restaurants and/or hotels and find details for planning you game day including a google map of the area.

Motivation

I wanted to compile all the information a sport's fan may want to have easy access to into a single location. No need to leave the app to find a restaurant before the game, or driving around trying to find convenient parking. Plan everything before you leave the comfort of your house.
